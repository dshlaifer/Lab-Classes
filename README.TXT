I created a student object and called the getName method, this tells me what
the name of the student object is.

In the object type LabClass I called for the NumberOfStudents and it showed zero
when my maximum student count was 20.

For some reason the printList is not going to the terminal I put all the information
for the Lab class.

 What are the types of the following values?
 0     Int
 “hello”  String
 101-1   int
 true  boolean
 “33”  int
 3.1415   float 
 
 
  32. What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle
  object? Add a name variable to the class then set value of name for each circle.
  
  To write a header for a method named send it would be 
  public void send(string message);
  
  to write a header for method named average
  public void average(int a, int b);
  
   Look at the book you are reading now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects.
 If it is an object, name its class.
 
Class Book objects are Title,Pages,Content.


An object only belongs to one class because its class defines what the object is.
